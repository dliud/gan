CS 229 Final Project (Spring 2020) -- GAN-Based Image Data Augmentation
by Nathan Hu and David Liu

To train GANs, run train_gans.py and modify the parameters in the main function (train_size, trial, alpha, num_gans).  Make sure the trial is not already used unless you want the previous data to be overwritten.
The train the classifier, run train_classifier.py and modify the parameters in the main function (num_real, num_synth, alpha, epoch).  Check the saved model path.
